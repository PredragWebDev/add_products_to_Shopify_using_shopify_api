63672a031c84e90547f970b1,Patron El Alto Reposado Tequila Jalisco Mexico,"Patron to enter the prestige tequila market
BYCHRIS MORRIS
November 4, 2022 at 11:48 AM EDT
Patron Tequila is ready to take a spot on the top shelf.

The company, on Monday, will debut Patron El Alto, a prestige new tequila expression that will be the company’s first foray into the super-premium space.

“We’ve been bold innovators when it comes to tequila,” D-J Hageman, vice president of marketing at Patron, tells Fortune. “This is us making a statement again.”

The new expression is made from agave grown in the highest parts of Jalisco, Mexico, which the company says yields the sweetest flavors. It combines Reposado, Añejo, and Extra Añejo tequilas aged in 11 types of barrels, resulting in a complex drink that is incredibly smooth with hints of vanilla, caramel, and fruit.

It has been a four-year development process for the company to launch El Alto, with more than 300 tastings internally to ensure master distiller David Rodriguez and his team got precisely the flavor they were striving for. Despite that time frame, quantities of the tequila are limited.

El Alto will sell for a suggested retail price of $179 and will initially only be available in New York, Miami, Las Vegas, and Los Angeles. As you might expect with the price tag, this isn’t the tequila you want to grab when mixing a margarita. It’s best enjoyed neat, though on the rocks is acceptable.
Tequila has been having a moment over the past few years. A report from CGA Strategy, published in September, found that people are increasingly opting for the agave-based beverage over brown liquors. It is, in fact, the only major spirit to show share growth this year.

A big part of that is coming from premium and super-premium offerings (the categorization comes down to the aging process and the use of 100% blue agave in the creation of the beverage). The Distilled Spirits Council of the US says sales of luxury spirits grew 43% in the last year, with tequila and American whiskey leading the charge. Tequila saw a 75% annual growth rate in that time.

“This is the pinnacle of what Patron thinks prestige tequila should be,” says Hageman.",Patron,,"alcohol, spirits, tequila","alcohol, spirits, tequila, tequila",TRUE,SIZE,750ml,,,,,,,shopify,2,deny,manual,214.49,134.39,TRUE,TRUE,7.22E+11,https://d3omj40jjfp5tk.cloudfront.net/products/63a228249b53e528f7863cbd/original.png,1,,FALSE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,g,,,TRUE,TRUE,,,active

The development of this expression started with an aim to deliver full flavors and richness of whisky like ""from the barrel"", which only blenders can sniff and taste.

The iconic square bottle reflects its concept ""a small block of whisky"" and embodies the intense and rich flavors of the whisky inside. Long after its launch, this bottle is still timeless and recognized for its ultimate simplicity. 

The complex formula is created by blending more than 100 different batches of malt and grain whiskies. After blending, the whisky is filled into used barrels and matured for another few months. This ""marriage"" process harmonizes all components in the formula, resulting in a mellow taste. Bottling is controlled at 51.4% ABV, almost equivalent to 90 British proof, that Nikka blenders determined through repeated experiments to achieve the ideal taste profile.",Nikka Whisky,,"alcohol, spirits, whiskey","alcohol, spirits, whiskey, whiskey",TRUE,SIZE,750ml,,,,,,,shopify,4,deny,manual,179.29,55.47,TRUE,TRUE,4.90E+12,https://d3omj40jjfp5tk.cloudfront.net/products/5ccc636b8cd33c73826b6bb2/original.png,1,,FALSE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,g,,,TRUE,TRUE,,,active

615f8afd657f6f3f440a851c,Midleton Very Rare Irish Whiskey 2021 Vintage Release,"Irish Distillers has unveiled the highly collectible Midleton Very Rare Vintage Release 2022 for the United States, following its initial release overseas earlier this year.

The 38th edition in the Midleton Very Rare series is described by the brand as a blend of rare and hand-selected single pot still and single grain Irish whiskies from Midleton’s extensive inventory, including whiskey aged between 15 and 36 years and matured in lightly charred ex-bourbon American oak barrels.  The official tasting notes speak of baked orchard fruits, lime zest and kiwi, perfectly rounded off with mild pot still spices and soft waves of vanilla from the exceptional bourbon casks.
Drawing on his experience in both distillation and maturation, Master Distiller Kevin O’Gorman, in his first time working on this release, elevated the grain whiskey contribution for the 2021 vintage to create a delicate and elegant whiskey and selected a mix of first-fill and second-fill casks to enhance the wood contribution while allowing the pot still component to express itself.

“It is an honor to join my predecessors in bringing the Midleton Very Rare collection to life,” O’Gorman said in a prepared statement. “The process has allowed me to explore our rarest casks to create an exceptional blend that builds on tradition while bringing a new dimension and we’re thrilled to bring this release to our customers in the US.”

Official tasting notes can be found below.
Aroma: Opens with a delicate floral perfume closely followed by roasted coffee beans, salted caramel and honeycomb coming to the fore. Hints of nectarines that linger in the background evolve over time along with freshly grated ginger and nutmeg spice. The American oak provides structure throughout, ranging in depth from fresh woodland notes to aged charred oak.
Taste: Baked orchard fruits with a touch of lime zest and kiwi. Mild pot still spices continue to build along with soft waves of vanilla, sweet coffee liqueur and cocoa powder. The texture initially round and full, gains additional wood spices with a delicate touch of clove oil and nutmeg adding a mild heat, giving balance to the sweetness.
Finish: Lingering finish with the pot still spices and soft fruits eventually fading, allowing the oak to have the final say, highlighting the many years of maturation.",,,"alcohol, spirits, whiskey","alcohol, spirits, whiskey, whiskey",TRUE,SIZE,750ml,,,,,,,shopify,3,deny,manual,274.99,195.99,TRUE,TRUE,80432112595,https://d3omj40jjfp5tk.cloudfront.net/products/642db15be990957ed98c1725/original.png,1,,FALSE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,g,,,TRUE,TRUE,,,active

In choosing the finishing cask type for this blend, the Sakura wood was one that was said to have “intrigued Fifth Generation Chief Blender Shinji Fukuyo.”
“I have been mesmerized by the Sakura cask for the last five years now due to its symbolism, but also because of its distinctive, subtly floral and spicy aroma and flavor notes,” said Fukuyo in a prepared statement. “There have been many experiments with malt and grain whisky components, and we found that there was a special alchemy between the grain whiskies and the Sakura cask.
“It is this special relationship – harmony – that inspired me to create this blend.”
In speaking to the symbolism noted above, the Sakura blossom season in early spring, it was explained by Suntory, “has always been an occasion for celebration in Japan, with many gathering around the beautiful flowering Sakura trees that inspire the Japanese to appreciate life as it blooms.”
“As a limited edition, I wanted our Hibiki aficionados to enjoy a Hibiki they had never experienced before – something unexpected, something surprising,” continued Fukuyo. “This is a Hibiki that celebrates a particular moment in your life, a harmony that blossoms. It would mean so much to me if you could enjoy it with someone special, someone who makes you blossom.”

The Hendrick’s Rickey is a beloved, refreshing and easy-to-make cocktail. However, Ms. Lesley Gracie, chooses to drink it with club soda, elderflower liqueur and garnished with 3 thinly sliced cucumber rounds.
Hand-crafted on the Southwest coast of Scotland in the decidedly un-ginnish town of Girvan, tiny batches of only 500 lovely litres are produced at a time, which gives Ms. Lesley Gracie, our Master Distiller and the inventor of Hendrick’s Gin, greater control of her careful artistry.
Hendrick’s Gin is created via an absurdly inefficient, yet quite glorious process. In essence, to make one gin, we first create two. One on an old-fashioned pot still, yielding a rich and intricate spirit. The other on along-necked Carter Head, producing a delicate, more refined spirit. Each still is infused with an unusual symphony of 11 botanicals. The gins from the two stills are then married together and graced with refreshing infusions of Rose and Cucumber.
This odd method of making gin enables Hendrick’s to taste light, yet intriguingly complex. The result is a wondrously refreshing gin with a delightfully floral aroma, elevating any cocktail and all occasions.

This wonderful bourbon is bottled as close to barrel proof as possible. We add just a splash of our Kentucky limestone well-water when we empty the barrels for bottling. Thus, this whiskey is as smooth as any you will find. The more water you add to whiskey from its natural barrel proof to its bottle proof, the harsher it becomes. This 107 barrel proof seems to be just right.

615a18635da4a34fd426ac7a,Little Book Chapter 5 The Invitation,"FREDDIE'S NOTE
Little Book® Chapter 5, “The Invitation,” is the fifth chapter in the Little Book Whiskey series. The Invitation offers a chance for any curious whiskey drinker to expand their palette - both seasoned connoisseurs and newcomers alike. The name of this year’s chapter offers fans of American whiskey an opportunity to experience liquid that I personally had a hand in creating and blending and showcases the innovation of Little Book chapters over the last five years.

Little Book Chapter 5 is a blend of four different liquid streams with a vast range of ages, flavors and distillation styles. Three of the four liquid streams contained in Chapter 5 were distilled under my watchful eye, and I’m thrilled to offer drinkers a whiskey that is both expansive and complex. With the base of this blend being a 2-year-old bourbon, this chapter continues to push the boundaries of blending and challenges what some might assume of lower aged whiskies. The way these liquid streams complement each other makes this liquid extremely approachable, even for those who haven’t given cask strength whiskey a try.

The Invitation was one of the more difficult chapters to perfect. Harmonizing such varied liquids and ages requires delicate balancing of flavors and immense amounts of patience, but the effort was certainly worth it when you taste the final product. Little Book Chapter 5 is my way of inviting Little Book drinkers into different aspects of the whiskey space, regardless of if they’ve been along for the ride since Chapter 1 or are just tasting Little Book for the first time.

5fb612d1bdfd80253ed7d591,Elijah Craig Small Batch Bourbon,"Following the defeat of the British at the Battle of Yorktown during the American Revolutionary War, the territory west of the Appalachian mountains became known as Kentucky County. At the time, the territory was considered part of Virginia, and was overseen by a military governor named John J. Bowman. In order to encourage westward expansion, Virginia issued pioneers who agreed to settle in Kentucky County ""corn writs,"" which granted the pioneers 60 acres of land if they agreed to settle in Kentucky and start farming corn.

One year after the defeat of the British, a Baptist minister named Elijah Craig emigrated to Fayette County (today, a part of the State of Kentucky) and purchased 1,000 acres of land in a town named Lebanon. In 1789, Craig built a distillery on his farm and is credited with being the first person to mature bourbon in charred, oak casks, earning him the title ""Father of Bourbon Whiskey.""

Elijah Craig Small Batch Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey pays homage to Craig and his unique legacy. The bourbon is bottled from the marriage of fewer than 100 casks of maturing bourbon, each of which is rested in a Kentucky rickhouse for a minimum of a dozen years.

Masataka valued the feature of this type of still and installed two sets of Coffey stills after he established Nikka Whisky. The first still was imported from Scotland to Japan in 1963, followed by the second still in 1966. These traditional Coffey stills are not easy to operate and not efficient to obtain spirits. However, they retain flavors originating from ingredients and deliver a distinctive creamy texture.
This is a signature grain whisky which was released in 2012.

J. Lohr Pure Paso artfully blends Cabernet Sauvignon and Petite Sirah – two J. Lohr benchmark varieties – into a unique proprietary red wine. The two varieties have long been intertwined in J. Lohr’s winegrowing history and, in particular, the Lohr family’s pioneering efforts in the Paso Robles region.

The very first J. Lohr commercial release in 1974 was a Petite Sirah. It was the search to find ideal conditions for growing Cabernet Sauvignon that led Jerry and his team to Paso Robles in the mid-1980s. More than thirty years of Family, Place, and Craft in Paso Robles have given J. Lohr a unique perspective on the region. That experience allows us to explore projects that speak directly to the appellation’s history, character, and sense of place.

J. Lohr Pure Paso is a culmination of our long history of innovation in Paso Robles. Its classic, dramatic packaging recalls Paso Robles’ frontier ethos.

629b7ab34ef75a26a38a8b4b,Basil Hayden Subtle Smoke Artfully Aged Straight Bourbon,"AN ENTIRELY NEW TAKE ON SMOKY SPIRITS
Basil Hayden Subtle Smoke features the same high-rye mash bill that Basil Hayden loyalists know and love, but uses secondary aging to deliver a unique, layered flavor with a refined hint of smokiness.

We begin by toasting and lightly charring the secondary barrel. This is followed by delicately igniting hickory-smoked chips at a constant feed to produce smoke, which is then pumped into the barrel, resulting in notes of soft char and light butterscotch. This unique flavor provides a smoother, more subtle take on smoky spirits, and creates the perfectly sophisticated, yet approachable introduction to both bourbon and Basil Hayden.

Serving Subtle Smoke neat or on the rocks allows the mellow smoke and sweet vanilla notes to shine while complementing the spicy rye flavors typical to Basil Hayden bourbon’s high-rye mash bill. At 80 proof, Subtle Smoke is light enough to examine on the palate without the burn typically associated with higher-proof or overly smoky spirits.",Basil Hayden's,,"alcohol, spirits, bourbon, whiskey","alcohol, spirits, bourbon, whiskey, bourbon, whiskey",TRUE,SIZE,750ml,,,,,,,shopify,5,deny,manual,60.49,38.3,TRUE,TRUE,80686012474,https://d3omj40jjfp5tk.cloudfront.net/products/644870ce15b55e2ab8efbde1/original.png,1,,FALSE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,g,,,TRUE,TRUE,,,active

61ce66ebac25967bc76ded34,Aberfeldy 18 Years Old Single Malt Scotch Finished In French Red Wine Casks,"John Dewar & Sons recently announced its latest limited single malt whisky, Aberfeldy 18 Years Old, finished in French red wine casks from France’s wine-making region Côte Rôtie.

Aberfeldy’s French Red Wine Cask Collection launched in 2019 with the first release of Aberfeldy 15 Year Old, finished in Pomerol casks from Bordeaux. The second release in 2020 was an 18 Year Old expression finished in Pauillac casks, also from Bordeaux.

For the third bottling in the series, Malt Master Stephanie Macleod chose what’s described as a robust and elegant style of wine for the most recent offering.
The Côte Rôtie is a well-known red wine appellation at the northern tip of France’s Rhône Valley. The area is only 40 miles long and is responsible for only about five percent of all the wines from the region. Côte Rôtie, translated as “Roasted Slope,” is home to some of the steepest vineyards in all of France.

Wines from this region are predominantly made from the Syrah grape, which thrives in the well-draining granite soils, offering depth of flavor and complex aromatics with dark red berry characteristics and silky textures.

Aberfeldy’s malt master, Macleod, said in a prepared statement this style of wine “has these wonderful fruity notes, but also floral notes and so it’s just a match made in heaven for Aberfeldy. These wine casks don’t come around very often, so when we were offered them, we snapped them up immediately.”

“The day they came on to our site we opened them up and I gave them a nose,” she recalled. “It was just amazing, I felt then and there this was going to work.”
Aberfeldy’s aged malt along with these casks, Macleod noted, have brought about a refined smoothness to the whisky hinting at fruits with rich, red berry characteristics.

She went on to explain that this dram “is bursting with intense, rich fruity red berry notes of raspberry, lingonberry and red currents smothered in honey. It’s deeply evocative of an Eton Mess as the sugariness and the sharpness of the berries come through. A zing of candied citrus peel brings balance before mellowing to a smooth vanilla and butterscotch sweetness.”",Aberfeldy,,"alcohol, spirits, scotch","alcohol, spirits, scotch, scotch",TRUE,SIZE,750ml,,,,,,,shopify,7,deny,manual,109.99,85.61,TRUE,TRUE,80480987305,https://d3omj40jjfp5tk.cloudfront.net/products/623a11869a81cb6444154309/original.png,1,,FALSE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,g,,,TRUE,TRUE,,,active

5fb602c6a56d353b27d37cf2,Diamond Reserve White Rum Superior Demerara,"<p>The evolution of rum distillation dates back nearly 400 years. Upon arriving in Guyana in 1498, Christopher Columbus began planting the soon-to-be cash crop, sugar cane. 150 years later the Dutch came to Guyana and established the first settlements of Essequibo and Berbice, introducing the cultivation of sugar cane along the coastal plain and the banks of the great rivers.</p>
<p>At its peak Guyana was home to over 300 sugar estates with distilleries, each producing their own signature rums. Over the years these 300 sugar estates were whittled down to one lone estate and distillery, “Plantation Diamond,” located on the east bank of the Demerara River.  The parent company for El Dorado and Diamond Reserve is Demerara Distillers Limited, aka “DDL,”  where Plantation Diamond is located.  They are the only producer of Demerara Rum in the world.</p>
<p>Diamond Reserve is the brand name of DDL’s introductory and lightly aged rums.  The Diamond Reserve brand was created to differentiate between the aged rums of El Dorado (3 years or more) and the introductory spirits produced by DDL.  These rums are designed to mix into cocktails, as well as for sipping on their own.</p>

The reverberations of the spices continue through a dry finish. With the grain as a canvas, the wine’s colors work particularly well here.” 91wa

New to the U.S. market in March 2015, this rose-gold whiskey is finished in former California Cabernet Sauvignon casks. The aroma shows nuts, vanilla and orchard fruit.

5fb695fe73f89025295bb02a,Old Pogue Master's Select Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey 91 Proof,"Just a decade after General Robert E. Lee surrendered to General Ulysses S. Grant at Appomattox Courthouse, Henry Edgar Pogue purchased the Old Time Distillery from O.H.P Thomas. Situated at the junction of the Ohio River and Limestone Creek — you may have lost a family member here if you ever forded a river playing Oregon Trail — Pogue registered the distillery with the State of Kentucky, making it only the third registered distillery in the state.

Soon after he acquired the distillery, Pogue renamed it after himself and began producing Old Pogue Bourbon. According to a newspaper account from January 25, 1900, Old Pogue Distillery had ""built up a large business strictly through honorable methods"" and ""enjoyed the reputation of being one of the best known and best patronized distilleries in the State of Kentucky.""

After his untimely death in a work-related accident in 1890, H.E. Pogue was succeeded by his son until 1918, when he too passed away during an accident at the distillery. Within two years, the 18th Amendment to the United States Constitution, which prohibited the sale and manufacture of alcohol, was passed, and H.E. Pogue III was forced to close the doors to the distillery that his grandfather purchased nearly 50 years ago. 

Today, the fourth and fifth generations of Pogues — H.E. Pogue IV and H.E. Pogue V — have returned to the family business. Old Pogue Master's Select Bourbon Whiskey is fashioned based on a recipe that was handwritten by H.E. Pogue III on three sheets of lined notebook paper.

After distillation, Old Pogue Master's Select is aged for nine years in new, American oak casks. Its notes of dried fruit — particularly prunes and apricots — and hints of caramel and vanilla have earned it a number of accolades, including the Double Gold Medal at the Fifty Best Tasting Competition in 2012 and a rating of ""Superb""by Wine Enthusiast.",,,"alcohol, spirits, bourbon, whiskey","alcohol, spirits, bourbon, whiskey, bourbon, whiskey",TRUE,SIZE,750ml,,,,,,,shopify,2,deny,manual,109.99,75,TRUE,TRUE,80203990070,https://d3omj40jjfp5tk.cloudfront.net/products/57342fc869702d3049b20500/original.png,1,,FALSE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,g,,,TRUE,TRUE,,,active

<p>Jefferson’s Reserve bourbon is the company’s second flagship brand, and the label under which they sold their first sourced whiskey when the company first started. Jefferson’s Reserve is a big, sophisticated bourbon that is nice and smooth and can easily be drank neat. However, adding a bit of water really expands this one and makes it better. Each batch consists of a blend of 8 to 12 barrels of four different bourbon recipes of different ages. The idea behind using older stock in the Reserve is that the longer maturation of the base whiskies gives the final blend more complexity, bigger taste and better flavour depth. On the palate it's a very summery, light and supple bourbon which offers good, clean delivery, pleasant sweetness, with stone fruit, baking spice, tobacco, brown sugar, oak, and creamy vanilla custard notes. </p>

626dc236074c2f07cbc8ea1d,Mi Campo Reposado Tequila 1L,"Mi Campo Reposado Tequila is a contemporary take on traditional agave tequila. Crafted using high-quality, 100% blue weber agave, this 80-proof tequila liquor is the color of light straw with hints of gold sparkle. A Mexican tequila created with passion and pride in the land from which it comes, this easy-drinking tequila offers layered aromas of cooked agave, ripe banana, apple, chocolate, and cappuccino, along with vanilla, cinnamon, pumpkin, and clove. On the palate, honey maple, peaches and cream, white chocolate, and a thread of minerality segue to a pepper and toasted oak finish. The agave pinas used to make this straight-from-the-corazon tequila are not crushed but rather squeezed before being cooked in stone ovens. Double-distilled in alembic stills, this tequila alcohol is aged for three weeks in French oak red wine barrels for a richer, smoother finish that's a reinterpretation of tradition.

The result of the extra aging is a distinct whiskey with big oak aromas along with hints of char and vanilla. Basil Hayden's trademark spice shines through as the perfect complement to the caramel sweetness and wood flavors, making the whiskey a memorable one for fans and newcomers alike.

Serving neat, with a drop of water, or on-the-rocks allows the sweet caramel and vanilla notes that develop from 10 years in a newly charred American Oak barrel to shine, complementing the spicy rye flavors typical to Basil Hayden Bourbon high-rye mash bill.

5fb601d7a56d353b27d30357,Balvenie 14 Year Caribbean Cask Single Malt Scotch Whisky,"The Balvenie Caribbean Cask 14 Year Old Single Malt Scotch Whisky is created by maturing The Balvenie first in traditional oak whisky casks before transferring the whisky to casks previously used to mature Caribbean rum. The resulting liquid has rich, sweet and creamy toffee on the nose combined with fresh fruit notes. The taste is rounded with vanilla and sweet oak notes, with a fruity character that develops with time, all encompassed in a soft and lingering finish. 
Best enjoyed neat, on the rocks or with a splash of water to expand the flavor.
The Balvenie is dedicated to the five rare crafts that are used to create The Balvenie’s distinctive taste. It is the only distillery that still grows its own barley, uses traditional floor maltings and keeps both coppersmiths and coopers on site – making The Balvenie one of the most handcrafted of malts.
The Balvenie is a unique range of single malt whiskies produced in Dufftown, Scotland’s Speyside region. Created by internationally renowned Malt Master David C. Stewart MBE, each variant in the range has its own unique taste, while still maintaining the recognizable undertones of the distinctively rich, smooth and honeyed character of The Balvenie. It has won awards at numerous international competitions, including an Outstanding Achievement in The Scotch Whisky Industry Award for David C. Stewart MBE at the 2019 International Wine & Spirit Competition.

A crescendo of dark, juicy plum and cassis fruit, violet, cinnamon and unsweetened cocoa linger on the palate, while each sumptuous sip boasts vibrant flavor and plush tannins with a lingering finish. Created based on what the vintage provides, this red wine blend of cabernet sauvignon, cabernet franc, merlot and petit verdot is sourced from two prized sub-regions of Napa Valley: Oakville and Stags Leap. This Napa Valley wine undergoes a total of 24 days of wine to skin contact, maximizing the extraction of varietal character while keeping the tannins fleshy and supple. Malolactic fermentation in French oak barrels assures seamless integration of fruit and oak. Pair a glass of this dark red wine with pork, beef, steak, pasta or lamb dishes. For optimal taste, store at room temperature, then refrigerate this bottle of wine for about 30 to 60 minutes before pouring.

615dc72d1a08e003dd3bee2b,The Macallan Rare Cask Single Malt Scotch Whisky(2021),"Rare Cask combines knowledge, skill, passion, commitment and creativity to create a remarkable whisky worthy of its name.

Crafted to showcase complexity and depth, Rare Cask is drawn from the broadest spectrum of casks used in maturation on The Macallan Estate. Hand-picked by our whisky making team, the combination of sherry seasoned American and European oak casks - a high proportion of them first fill - deliver an exquisite and unmistakably woody whisky with a rich hue.

Incomparable access to the most extensive range of cooperages in Spain gives us some of the finest and scarcest casks to choose from to create Rare Cask, which results in a diversity in the finished whisky unlike other Macallan expression. It is the role of the whisky making team to get to know each and every cask in detail, from how it interacts with the spirit to the spectrum of colours it imparts. This relationship between cask and craftsman, spirit and skill, ultimately give us Rare Cask.


With rarity at its core, this is a whisky that will slightly differ in makeup from bottling to bottling; with some casks so rare they will never be used again in any other Macallan. Far less than 1% of casks maturing at the distillery have been identified as fitting to bestow the Rare Cask name – and enable the creation of this multifaceted single malt.

Taking inspiration from The Macallan’s iconic triangle and designed to celebrate its natural color, Rare Cask is presented in a sculpted, heavy glass decanter.",The Macallan,,"alcohol, spirits, scotch, single malt, whiskey","alcohol, spirits, scotch, single malt, whiskey, scotch, single malt, whiskey",TRUE,SIZE,750ml,,,,,,,shopify,8,deny,manual,417.99,279.46,TRUE,TRUE,8.12E+11,https://d3omj40jjfp5tk.cloudfront.net/products/626fe3a26c440e2cb25086a8/original.png,1,,FALSE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,g,,,TRUE,TRUE,,,active

5fb6042ca56d353b27d42e03,Tito's Handmade Vodka,"Founded by sixth-generation Texan, Tito Beveridge, Tito’s Handmade Vodka is known for its high-quality product, charitable contributions, and goal to make people happy while making the world a better place. From the start, Tito got a kick out of infusing vodka for friends and quickly became known as “the vodka guy.” With a dream to do what he loved, and a dog by his side, he pursued a career in the spirits industry, risking it all until he sold his first case. 

Over twenty-five years later, Tito’s Handmade Vodka has stayed true to its roots and is designed to be savored by both spirit connoisseurs and those who enjoy a simple cocktail. Our gluten-free, low-calorie* vodka is American-made, unflavored, and distilled using old-fashioned copper pot stills, inspired by the distillation methods of fine single malt scotches and high-end French cognacs. Over 25 years later, the process remains the same; Tito’s is made in batches, with each batch taste-tested, and goes down smooth with an impeccably clean finish. From a Bloody Mary at brunch, a martini at cocktail hour, or a simple Tito’s and soda with friends – just add Tito’s and enjoy! Distilled and bottled on the same land in Austin, Texas, Tito’s Handmade Vodka is made from 100% corn and is naturally gluten-free. Available in Liter, 1.75L, 750mL, 375mL, 200mL, and 50mL sizes.

6424e90d68c5413fd6a2d009,Whistlepig The Boss Hog 9th Edition Siren's Song Barrel Aged Straight Rye Whiskey Canada,"Single Barrel, Bottled at Proof, Powerfully Complex, Distinctly Unique From Anything We’ve Done Before. Stupendous.


This autumn we unveil the latest chapter in The Boss Hog odyssey, a journey through parts previously unknown in the world of whiskey. It begins with some of the oldest Rye on our Farm. Then, a double finish in barrels formerly belonging to Greek fig nectar and scratch made Tentura – a Greek style liqueur inspired by Ancient Patras.

Siren’s Song is the result… an adventure for the ages, befitting its own ode. It beckons you with refrains of supple sweetness and exotic spice. Honoring our five promises for every edition of The Boss Hog, you are guaranteed a stupendous and powerfully complex whiskey; single barrel in origin, bottled at proof and unique from anything you’ve ever before tasted. And for the first time ever, the cask finishes for this particular edition were crafted by our own whiskey makers: Liz Rhoades and Meghan Ireland.

The dynamic duo were inspired by the Muses of Greek Mythology – each of whom is depicted on one of nine bespoke pewter toppers: Calliope, Clio, Erato, Euterpe, Melpomene, Polyhymnia, Terpsichore, Thalia, and Urania. Amass them all if you dare; these others of creation also birthed the mischievous and mysterious sirens.

Another first for the collection – the back label of The Boss Hog IX comes equipped with NFC technology, enabling collectors to authenticate and register their treasure with one tap of a smartphone.

A happy homecoming awaits…

This rare and outstandingly complex whiskey is barrel strength, bottled between 102.5 – 106.2 proof.

We have created a remarkable collection comprising six limited edition bottles inspired by each of The Six Decades of Bond, telling the story of innovation over 60 years and the pioneering character attributes of James Bond and The Macallan.</p>
<p>The packaging of each bottle features an original illustrative design and colour to denote the decade it represents. The distinctive artwork brings to life the creative development process of the films in a behind the scenes exploration of the James Bond archives.</p>
<p>The 1960s was a singular decade for James Bond. The debut of the suave spy icon onto the silver screen in 1962 was embodied by the inimitable Sean Connery, who went on to appear in six films across the next ten years. Resting only when George Lazenby starred in On Her Majesty’s Secret Service in 1969, Sir Sean was to roar back in triumph in 1971’s Diamonds Are Forever. </p>
<p>The pack design includes sketches from Goldfinger (1964), You Only Live Twice (1967) where Little Nellie is in a combat sequence, and the dummy jet pack worn by Bond in Thunderball (1965).</p>
<p>This exceptional single malt whisky has been created by The Macallan Master Whisky Maker, Kirsteen Campbell to reflect the character of James Bond. A force of nature defined by his Scottish heritage, he carries himself with modesty and humility.

61b3e479cb41481d6fc3ee5c,Hibiki Harmony Japanese Whisky Limited Edition,"From its introduction in 1989, the Hibiki bottle is presented with 24 facets. The design symbolizes the 24 hours of a day, as well as the 24 seasons of the year in the traditional Japanese lunar calendar. The 2021 limited edition pays tribute to the Ryusui-Hyakka (One-Hundred Flowers and Flowing Water). The design motif epitomizes the cyclical passage of time, showcasing the blossoms of the Japanese twenty-four seasons juxtaposed with the ever-changing flow of water that connects one passing season to another. The Hibiki bottle celebrates the much-loved blooms, colors and shapes of seasonal flowers that make the Japanese year so special. A deep appreciation for the seasons and a sensitivity for the passage of time accounts for the Japanese culture's unique sense of harmony with nature. In tune with Suntory's philosophy, the design bottle series is the next iteration of the brand's continuous pursuit of harmony.

""The iconic Hibiki bottle has always been a representation of Japanese art and design, as represented by the many limited-edition series over the past ten years,"" said Jon Potter, Managing Director of the House of Suntory. ""This specially-designed bottle is not only the continuation of this artistic expression, it honors Hibiki and Suntory's ethos to live in Harmony with nature. In 2021, this philosophy may echo with the world more than ever.""

The Hibiki brand was introduced to the world in 1989 and since then has been embraced as the paragon of Japanese Whisky. It is not only Japan's most highly awarded blended whisky, but also among the most prestigious and honored whiskies in the world. Introduced in 2015, Hibiki Japanese Harmony is a harmonious blend blessed with the riches of Japanese nature and craftsmanship. Hibiki Japanese Harmony is a meticulous blend of the finest selection of malt and grain whiskies from the House of Suntory Whisky's Yamazaki, Hakushu and Chita distilleries.

We have created a remarkable collection comprising six limited edition bottles inspired by each of The Six Decades of Bond, telling the story of innovation over 60 years and the pioneering character attributes of James Bond and The Macallan.</p>
<p>The packaging of each bottle features an original illustrative design and colour to denote the decade it represents. The distinctive artwork brings to life the creative development process of the films in a behind the scenes exploration of the James Bond archives.</p>
<p>The 1960s was a singular decade for James Bond. The debut of the suave spy icon onto the silver screen in 1962 was embodied by the inimitable Sean Connery, who went on to appear in six films across the next ten years. Resting only when George Lazenby starred in On Her Majesty’s Secret Service in 1969, Sir Sean was to roar back in triumph in 1971’s Diamonds Are Forever. </p>
<p>The pack design includes sketches from Goldfinger (1964), You Only Live Twice (1967) where Little Nellie is in a combat sequence, and the dummy jet pack worn by Bond in Thunderball (1965).</p>
<p>This exceptional single malt whisky has been created by The Macallan Master Whisky Maker, Kirsteen Campbell to reflect the character of James Bond. A force of nature defined by his Scottish heritage, he carries himself with modesty and humility.

NOSE
Spiced orange candy, dill, rye spice, clove, some earthy underpinnings, a bit of wood and a spice that reminds me Moroccan food.

PALATE
Ambiguous sweetness, rye spice, dill, gummy orange slices candy, cinnamon, clove, a touch of wood and raw grains. The dill in both the nose and the palate remind me of other MGP 95% rye whiskies like Bulleit rye, Dickel rye and some of the Willet rye releases which makes sense.

FINISH
Medium in length with notes of clove, cinnamon, dill, anise, wood, and rye which pops a bit as it fades out, or maybe that’s the flavoring chemicals popping on my tongue. Your guess is as good as mine.

5fb60235a56d353b27d330cc,Monkey Shoulder Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,"Monkey Shoulder is a blend of Speyside single malt Scotch whiskies married together for flavor and consistency. The richness and vibrancy combine with fruity aromas and mellow vanilla, making it perfect for mixed drinks and cocktails. Monkey Shoulder casks are former bourbon casks, which add smooth vanilla flavors to this Scotch. It also has no grain whisky whatsoever anywhere in or even near the drink. It's barley all the way, folks.
The name Monkey Shoulder might sound funny, but it has a history in whisky making. The maltmen who used to turn the barley would take long shifts, using their dominant arm significantly while working. At the end of the day, their shoulders would droop on one side, an ailment that became known as ""Monkey Shoulder."" Thankfully, the condition no longer exists, but the name lives on in our whisky.
Monkey Shoulder is made for mixing and stands out most in mixed drinks, given its orange and vanilla flavors with a bit of spice. Refreshingly approachable, try it in easy-to-make cocktails like whisky and soda (“Monkey Splash”), whisky and ginger ale (“Ginger Monkey”), and the “Lazy Old Fashioned.” Check out for the recipes!

Whilst no two casks will ever produce an identical single malt, because of the careful sampling and selection by our Malt Master, The Balvenie single barrel sherry cask has a consistent character that is rich with elegant oak and subtle spice. Dried fruits are overlaid with a gentle nuttiness, leading to a long and sherried finish.
Best enjoyed neat, on the rocks or with a splash of water to expand the flavor.
The Balvenie is dedicated to the five rare crafts that are used to create The Balvenie’s distinctive taste. It is the only distillery that still grows its own barley, uses traditional floor maltings and keeps both coppersmiths and coopers on site – making The Balvenie one of the most handcrafted of malts.
The Balvenie is a unique range of single malt whiskies produced in Dufftown, Scotland’s Speyside region. Created by internationally renowned Malt Master David C. Stewart MBE, each variant in the range has its own unique taste, while still maintaining the recognizable undertones of the distinctively rich, smooth and honeyed character of The Balvenie. It has won awards at numerous international competitions, including an Outstanding Achievement in The Scotch Whisky Industry Award for David C. Stewart MBE at the 2019 International Wine & Spirit Competition.

5fb603cba56d353b27d40144,Parker's Heritage Collection 12th Edition Orange Curacao Barrel Finished Bourbon Whiskey 750ml,"Difficult to find, this unique bourbon is finished in orange curacao barrels.

Tasting: Traditional bourbon notes of vanilla and caramel upfront that are quickly washed over with a wave of orange soda, candied fruits, and mild barrel char. Its medium intensity of aromas are a bit strange at first, yet not alarmingly so, as the orange notes are certainly unique and welcoming. It’s worth pointing out that its aromas intensify in a more open air glass than a traditional glencairn.

A flash of orange marmalade, orange sponge candy, slight bitterness, and sugary alcoholic bite instantly reminds me of Grand Marnier. Seasoned oak and hearty vanilla notes roll in, bumping out the majority of the Orange Curaçao barrel finish.

Seasoned oak and vanilla notes carry over into the finish and dominate. Sugary orange notes weave throughout but don't overpower. As the heartier bourbon and barrel notes subside, orange marmalade becomes more noticeable again and nicely caps this bourbon off.

Production: 7 year old bourbon finished in orange curaçao barrels for approximately 90 days.",,,"alcohol, spirits, bourbon, whiskey","alcohol, spirits, bourbon, whiskey, bourbon, whiskey",TRUE,SIZE,750ml,,,,,,,shopify,1,deny,manual,1099.99,134.25,TRUE,TRUE,96749021925,https://d3omj40jjfp5tk.cloudfront.net/products/5c8fd86885c80378829d889f/original.png,1,,FALSE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,g,,,TRUE,TRUE,,,active

Through the nose, Hennessy V.S brings together an intense and fruity character with pleasantly oaky notes. When savored, powerful flavors suggest grilled almonds, supported by lively notes reminiscent of fresh grapes.

Each batch comes from a different field or rancho contributing distinctive characteristics of that place.

La Ladera (Spanish for “The Hillside”) faces West and has an average 8% slope. This rancho has a total area of 86 acre with an altitude between 2,100 to 2,150 meters above sea level. The land is a rocky slope with a shallow red mineral soil and low to medium fertility. Due to such conditions, the agave plants have relatively low average weight. Nevertheless, the sugar level is high, above 30% of the total weight, due to the stressful conditions in which the plant grows during its full life cycle.

Milagro Reposado is a 100% blue agave tequila which is rested in American oak barrels for 2-4 months.

Milagro Reposado tequila is best enjoyed neat, on the rocks or used to create your new favorite cocktail – like the Paloma Rosada! A bright & fresh take on a traditional Paloma with Milagro Reposado.
Inspired by the upbeat energy and creativity of Mexico City, Milagro Tequila is hand-crafted in a process where tradition meets innovation. Our agave is sourced in the Jalisco Highlands, where the finest, sweetest blue agave in the world is cultivated. To extract all of the nuances of the precious agave flavor, the agave piñas are slow-roasted for 36 hours in traditional brick ovens. The extracted juice is then fermented and is finally distilled twice: first, in a pot still to retain the vibrant and mouthwatering flavors of the agave and second, in a column still to impart an absolutely exquisite smoothness that compares to the finest white spirits in the world.

The wines were manufactured through relatively warm fermentation, while the grape skins continue to soak, to reveal the true constituents of the grapes, instilling complexity to the structure of the wine.

The different wines were matured in a collection of prestigious French casks. During the maturation period of 21 months, the numerous tastings we conducted, allowed us to recognize how the wines developed their harmony and elegance. From these which we chose a handful of top-quality casks to produce the bottled wine that makes it to your glass.

6036eb6531bc8351912625ae,Teeling Blackpitts Single Malt Irish Whiskey,"Inspired by the old ancient Blackpitts area just behind the new Teeling Whiskey Distillery based in Newmarket in the old Liberties area of Dublin City, this area was synonymous with many industries and in particular malting houses. Blackpitts was traditionally home to some of the largest barley malting houses in Ireland. By using smoke from peat to dry the barley during the malting process, the resulting peated malt produces a distinctive smoky taste profile which is the signature of a Peated Single Malt.

However, what makes Teeling Blackpitts so unique is the triple distillation process, which reduces some of the medicinal character you would get from a traditional Scottish Peated Single Malt and allows the more barbeque smoke characteristic to shine. This is then combined with signature Teeling innovative cask maturation using both ex-bourbon and ex-Sauternes white wine casks, which is bottled at 46% with no chill filtration to produce a truly different and unique expression of Teeling and Irish Whiskey. The inspiration for the use of these casks came from a previous bottling of Teeling 24-Year-Old Single Malt which was honoured as the “World’s Best Single Malt” in 2019 at the World Whiskies Awards.",Teeling,,"alcohol, spirits, whiskey","alcohol, spirits, whiskey, whiskey",TRUE,SIZE,750ml,,,,,,,shopify,6,deny,manual,79.19,59.99,TRUE,TRUE,8.13E+11,https://d3omj40jjfp5tk.cloudfront.net/products/600a60c6843df126ea10a2c4/original.png,1,,FALSE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,g,,,TRUE,TRUE,,,active

The Glenlivet French Oak 15-year-old blended whisky stands out for the eponymous French oak casks used in the distilling process. The result is an earthy, lingering bouquet no other label can replicate. A tried-and-true product from Scotland's oldest legal distillery, Glenlivet 15-Year Scotch whisky is created through a process similar to making cognac, lending it a slightly sweet and abundantly flavorful profile. The remarkable maturation process delivers a whisky known for its nutty, spicy, and fruity hue with notes of apple, grape, nuts, and spices. Distilling the Scotch in French oak casks for so long also infuses hints of nutmeg and cinnamon. The Glenlivet 15-Year French Oak Scotch has a 40% ABV and is perfectly at home in sweet mixed drinks.

No fruit compares to the pomegranate. The deep crimson color; the dense pulpy flesh; the rich red juice; even the time of year when it ripens – all of these singular characteristics, along with the tales of mystery and romance woven around it, make the pomegranate rare and unequalled. 

The pomegranate has come a long way since the beginning of time, revered throughout history as a symbol of health, fertility, and rebirth. It is believed that the pomegranate may have been the “apple” in the Garden of Eden. Ancient Greeks believed it was a symbol of love and war. Another Greek myth tells how Hades, god of the underworld seduced Persephone with a pomegranate. 

The fall harvest offers a freshness and juiciness within the tempting fruit that cannot be experienced any other time of year. The pomegranates chosen for PAMA are selected at their peak for ripeness and flavor.",,,"alcohol, spirits, liqueur","alcohol, spirits, liqueur, liqueur",TRUE,SIZE,750ml,,,,,,,shopify,24,deny,manual,21.99,16.79,TRUE,TRUE,96749940035,https://d3omj40jjfp5tk.cloudfront.net/products/56caccba75627527c4140100/original.jpg,1,,FALSE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,g,,,TRUE,TRUE,,,active

Creating a refined balance of spicy sweetness and rich dried fruit flavours.
Best enjoyed neat, on the rocks, with a splash of water, or with club soda to expand the flavor.
It is For over 130 years Glenfiddich has been one of the few single malt distilleries to remain entirely family owned and our whisky has become the world's most awarded single malt Scotch whisky, a true reflection of the passion, integrity and innovative spirit championed by a traditional fermentation process that has been passed down through the generations.
The Great American Rivers once transported fine oak casks filled with American bourbon towards New Orleans. Bourbon casks could only be used once, their aromas and flavours released quickly, without being exhausted by long maturation. Excellent for ageing single malt Scotch. Our second release in the Age of Discovery collection and a first for us, Bourbon Cask Reserve is inspired by that history.
Glenfiddich was founded by William Grant to fulfil a lifelong ambition of creating the 'best dram in the valley' and named 'Valley of the Deer' in Gaelic.

5fcbc3b292a850779bf6b39e,Caymus Vineyards Cabernet Sauvignon,"Caymus Vineyards remains 100% family-owned by the Wagners. Charlie, Lorna Belle, and Chuck worked together as a remarkable team for over 30 years building Caymus Cabernet. Today, Chuck, his two sons, Charlie and Joe, and one daughter, Jenny, have joined the family team. Farming grapes remain the priority with the family farming about 350 acres of choice Napa Valley land.
The Wagners took the name Caymus from the Mexican land grant known as Rancho Caymus, given to George Yount in 1836, which encompassed what eventually became the town of Rutherford and much of the surrounding area.

The Cabernet bottlings have aromas and flavors which can only be achieved through “hang time” – a technique which chances the loss of crop if early winter sets in. Leaving the fruit to “hang” on the vine unusually long develops suppleness, increases color, and matures the tannins of the grapes. The wines are abundant in textural tannins yet soft as velvet. Crop thinning, allowing measured sunlight to reach the vine’s fruit zone, and waiting for increased ripeness are all part of our viticultural practices.

Nuances of graphite and sea salt bring another dimension that come together with a bright acidity driving a long, lively finish.</p><p><b>PRODUCTION NOTES</b> - Grapes were harvested in the early morning hours to ensure the fruit arrived at the winery at cool temperatures. Clusters and individual berries were carefully hand-sorted before being fully destemmed to fall uncrushed into the fermenters. After a cold soak for approximately 6 days at 50°F, the loose berries were fermented using native yeasts in small open-top fermenters. The wine was left on the skins for an average of 20 days. The must was pressed using a traditional basket press, settled overnight and gravity fed into French Oak barrels for cellaring. The wine was aged 11 months on light lees before racking once and blending just before bottling.</p><p><b>PARK PLACE SOMMELIER PAIRING</b> -&nbsp;<span style=""font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline;"">Pair with roasted/grilled meats with an herbal/savory preparation, hearty stews &amp; sauces and </span><span style=""font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline;"">tomato-based sauces &amp; stews</span><span style=""font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline;"">.

5fb60381a56d353b27d3db3d,Cody Road Bourbon,"In 1846, William Buffalo Bill Cody was born in LeClaire, Iowa. On his journey down the road of life, he inspired and entertained many. Cody Road Bourbon is named in his honor.We put a unique signature on this spirit. You may not know that over 90% of American whiskies are made by 8 distilleries. While they make great whiskies, there are a lot of similarities. We feel craft distilling is at the same point that craft brewing was 15-20 years ago when the market saw only beer and light beer. Then the small guys introduced new and exciting flavors that changed the face of beer in this country. We want to be part of a similar revolution in spirits.This bourbon is made form a mash of 70% corn from LeClaire, 20% wheat and 10% unmalted barley from Reynolds, IL. It is aged for one year in newly charred 30 gallon oak barrels, about half the size of a traditional whiskey barrels.Cody Road Bourbon is a flavor and aroma experience unlike any other. Enjoy sweetness of corn, light fruit from wheat and a grassy, nutty finish from the unmalted barley. Vanilla and caramel from the oak dance around the sweet grain. Bottled at 90 proof, this bourbon has enough kick to know it's bourbon, but a beautifully smooth finish. It is a grain forward whiskey by design, as our whole story here is about the local grain we use in each batch. A remarkably unique flavor with our signature smoothness.

6150dc0b8f61cb180c93f19e,Redemption Rye Whiskey,"STYLE
Redemption Rye’s goal is to bring back the classic American Rye cocktail. While the Federal law states that a whiskey must be 51% rye grain to be classified as a rye, we chose to push our grain content to 95%. This not only pushes the flavor forward, but it also magnifies the unique profile of the rye grains.

TASTE PROFILE
Beautiful flavored rye spice with light floral and citrus notes. Slight mint finish makes this great for sipping or mixing in a classic cocktail. (Think Manhattan, Old Fashioned, and Sazerac). True Rye flavor.

Paul Ricard developed Ricard® in 1932 in Marseille, France. Ricard’s® secret recipe, unaltered since its creation, is composed of selected herbs and spices including Chinese star anise, Syrian licorice, and aromatic herbs from Provence, France.

On the palate, refreshing notes of licorice and star anise are followed by gentle hints of fruits, wood, and spices. The mouth feel is medium-bodied, and the finish long and pleasant.

Ricard® Pastis was chosen Exceptional Pastis at the International Review of Spirits Awards in 2014.

5fb603b8a56d353b27d3f6fc,Ron Viejo De Calidas 3 Year Anejo,"Established in 1928 Ron Viejo De Caldas is imported from Columbia by Industria Licorera De Caldas. Researching the rum, very little can be found about production other than that it is distilled from molasses. Once distilled the rum is aged in barrels made from white Columbian oak in a barrel house located 2.200 feet above sea level.

Appearance

The rum is packaged in a squat 750 ml bottle and sealed with a plastic cap. The front and back labels provide the minimum information required by law.

The rum in the bottle and glass holds a solid gold amber color. Swirling the liquid creates a thick band that quickly spins off equally thick fast moving legs. This band beads up and forms legs that drop into the glass a few times before finally leaving a ring of residue around the glass.

Nose

The aroma of the rum delivers notes of sweet caramel, ripe banana, and charred wood.

Palate

The first sip of the rum is buttery caramel forward, immediately followed by the banana notes from the aroma. Additional sips introduce sweet butterscotch, smoke, with charred and raw oak tannins that envelop the tongue leading to a mineral rich, lightly dry, and alcohol laden finish that just seems to go flat and run out of steam.",Ron Viejo De Caldas,,"alcohol, spirits, rum","alcohol, spirits, rum, rum",TRUE,SIZE,750ml,,,,,,,shopify,25,deny,manual,17.59,12.48,TRUE,TRUE,87752026502,https://d3omj40jjfp5tk.cloudfront.net/products/5f0737c3388cd641e03ce145/original.png,1,,FALSE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,g,,,TRUE,TRUE,,,active
